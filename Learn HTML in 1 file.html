   What is HTML ?
  ----------------
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
It is the standard markup language used to create and design the structure of web pages and web applications.
HTML uses a system of elements or tags to define the various parts of 
a document, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. 
These elements are marked by opening and closing tags, and they form the building blocks of a webpage.

   Advantage of HTML
  -------------------

HTML offers several advantages that contribute to its widespread use in web development:

 Ease of Learning and Use:
HTML is relatively simple to learn and use, making it accessible for beginners. Its syntax is straightforward, and it doesn't require complex programming skills.

 Platform Independence:
HTML is platform-independent, meaning it can be viewed on any device with a web browser. This universality contributes to the widespread compatibility of web content.

 Standardization:
HTML is an open standard maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This standardization ensures consistency and compatibility across different browsers and platforms.

 Compatibility with Other Technologies:
HTML can be easily integrated with other web technologies, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity. This trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript forms the foundation of modern web development.

 SEO-Friendly:
Search engines can easily index and understand HTML content. Properly structured HTML, with meaningful tags and attributes, can positively impact a webpage's search engine ranking.

 Scalability:
HTML is scalable for both small and large projects. It provides flexibility for creating simple static web pages or complex dynamic web applications.

 Accessibility:
HTML supports accessibility features, allowing developers to create content that is inclusive and accessible to users with disabilities. Proper semantic HTML helps assistive technologies interpret and present content to users.

 Responsive Design:
HTML plays a crucial role in creating responsive web designs. By combining HTML with CSS media queries, developers can ensure that web pages adapt to various screen sizes and devices.

 File extension:
You can easily make a text file and run on any device with a browser  

In summary, HTML is a fundamental technology for web development, providing a structured way to create content that is universally accessible and easily understood by both browsers and developers.

   Can all devices view/supports HTML?
  -------------------------------------

HTML is fully cross platform, most elements will work in all browsers, 
but they may not be displayed exactly the same. And remember that if our CSS doesn't load, 
HTML is still fully functional, readable, and understandable. 
handheld friendly & mobile optimized are for older devices.
